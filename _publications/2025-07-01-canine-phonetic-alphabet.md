title: "Toward Automatic Discovery of a Canine Phonetic Alphabet"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2025-canine-phonetic-alphabet
excerpt: 'Dogs communicate intelligently but little is known about the phonetic properties of their vocalization communication. For the first time, this paper presents an iterative algorithm inspired by human phonetic discovery, which is based on minimal pairs that determine phonemes by distinguishing different words in human language, and is able to produce a complete alphabet of distinct canine phoneme-like units.'
